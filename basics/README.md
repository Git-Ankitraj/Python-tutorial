# Advanced

If you want to learn more advanced techniques, you can also read this
section. Most of the techniques explained here are great when you're
working on a large project, and your code would be really repetitive
without these things.

You can experient with these things freely, but please **don't use these
techniques just because you know how to use them.** Prefer the simple
techniques from the Basics part instead when possible. Simple is better
than complex.

1. [Handy data types](/advanced/datatypes)
2. [Advanced stuff with functions](/advanced/functions)
3. [Magic methods](/advanced/magicmethods)
4. [Iterables, iterators and generators](/advanced/iters)
